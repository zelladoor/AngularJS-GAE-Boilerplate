AngularJS-GAE-Boilerplate
=========================

An Angularjs Google App Engine (python) boilerplate built for rapid prototyping.


## Why build an AngularJS GAE Boilerplate?
> In computer programming, boilerplate code or boilerplate is the sections of code that have to be included in many places with little or no alteration.
- [Wikipedia] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boilerplate_code)

I believe that AngularJS and GAE are powerful tools for not only production work but rapid prototyping. It is my hope that a unified boilerplate will help to abstract away the little annoyances that occur everytime I start a new angularJS-appengine project. Namely,

1. Secure server-side auth
2. Enpoints api config
3. Client-side auth
4. 'Social' login auth


These items are yet to be implemented but will be available soon.
